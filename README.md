# Home Assistant Containerized
Home Asisstant containerized with docker-compose

## Goal of this project
This project aims for easy setup and maintainability.

As Home Asisstant (HA) offers a lot of possibilities out of the box this project
focuses on adding functionality that expands connectivity or adds value by
useful functionality. MQTT and ZigBee allows to connect to [a lot of devices](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/).

## Setup
### Secrets
Personal data and secrets for docker-compose are stored in a .env file.
Secrets for mosquitto will be generated by the user and then stored in the 
mosquitto/ folder.

### User and Group (for mosquitto)
Mosquitto will use UID 1883 as default. You can add a corresponding user to your system and add your user to the group.
```bash
 $ sudo groupadd --gid 1883 mosquitto
 $ sudo useradd --no-create-home -g mosquitto --uid 1883 mosquitto
 $ sudo usermod -aG mosquitto USERNAME
```

### mosquitto (MQTT broker)
- The mosquitto setup is inspired by [vvatelot mosquitto-docker-compose](https://github.com/vvatelot/mosquitto-docker-compose)
- mosquitto is used as MQTT broker.
- Config, logs and persistent data is stored in a separate mosquitto/ folder.
- This setup uses usename and password for authentication.
>Optionally you could add more security by adding TLS: [Mosquitto TLS](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto-tls-7.html)
- To allow the mosquitto container access to its files I recommend to give the
  used user and group access:
```bash
  $ sudo chown -R 1883:1883 mosquitto/
```
- To set up the login run:
```bash
  $ docker-compose up -d mosquitto
```
- And substitute "\<USERNAME\>" "\<PASSWORD\>" to generate an according entry in 
  mosquitto/config/password.txt
```bash
  $ docker-compose exec mosquitto mosquitto_passwd \
    -b /mosquitto/config/password.txt <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>
  $ docker-compose restart
```
- The same command can be used to update a password.

> **NOTE**: \
> "mosquitto_passwd -b" option should be used with care because the
> password will be visible on the command line and in command history.
> Find more details here: [mosquitto_passwd manpage](https://mosquitto.org/man/mosquitto_passwd-1.html)

- To test the command install a mosquitto client:
```bash
  Arch
  $ sudo pacman -S mosquitto  
  UBUNTU
  $ sudo apt-get install mosquitto-clients
```
- And run the following command in one terminal (nothing will happen
  as it only starts listening):
```bash
  $ mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "hello/world"
```
- Then run in another terminal:
```bash
  $ mosquitto_pub -h localhost -u <USERNAME> -P <PASSWORD> -t hello/world -m "Hi"
```
_This example uses mosquitto but any other MQTT client should work._

- mosquitto.conf
```
password_file /mosquitto/config/password.txt
allow_anonymous false
user mosquitto
listener 1883
persistence true
persistence_location /mosquitto/data/
log_dest file /mosquitto/log/mosquitto.log
log_dest stdout
```

### zigbee2mqtt
https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io

Allows you to use your Zigbee devices without the vendors bridge/gateway. It act as a "driver" for a Zigbee Adapter. [List of supported devices](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/adapters/)

#### Prerequisites
- At first you need to have a supported Zigbee Adapter:
  - https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/supported-hardware.html
  - I started with a CC2531 and upgraded to SONOFF Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle Plus
- Then you find the location of the device:
  - https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/installation/01_linux.html#determine-location-of-the-adapter-and-checking-user-permissions

#### Setup
- The setting for zigbee2mqtt can be set in the docker-compose.yaml as env vars
- A basic config is in the zigbee2mqtt folder
- The documentation provides a lot of further possibilities [docu](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/configuration/)
- To improve security it is highly recommended to use a custom network key. Because
  the default key is well known. [set custom network key:](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/configuration/zigbee-network.html#network-config)

#### Troubleshooting
> A change of zigbee2mqtt config file or docker-compose env variables does not
> get applied:
- After the config of zigbee2mqtt changed do docker compose down (not just restart)

> I changed the network_key but get an error of an already existing pan_id!
This is annoying but you have 2 options:
- 1. Try to reduce! the range of your zigbee device (remove antenna) and try again
- 2. Change the pan_id in the config

## Home Assistant Configuration
To use the full potential of HA you can start on the following link and study the given examples:

If you have set up your first devices you may want to do something smart:
